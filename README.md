## Data Model

### Invoice Schema

```javascript
{
  invoiceNumber: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true
  },
  date: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now
  },
  dueDate: {
    type: Date,
    required: true
  },
  client: {
    name: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    },
    email: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    },
    address: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    }
  },
  items: [{
    description: {
      type: String,
      required: true
    },
    quantity: {
      type: Number,
      required: true
    },
    price: {
      type: Number,
      required: true
    },
    amount: {
      type: Number,
      required: true
    }
  }],
  subtotal: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  tax: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  total: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['draft', 'sent', 'paid', 'overdue'],
    default: 'draft'
  }
}
```

## Response Codes

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request
- `404` - Not Found
- `500` - Server Error

## Error Handling

The API returns error messages in the following format:
```json
{
  "message": "Error description here"
}
```

## PDF Generation

The PDF generation endpoint creates a formatted invoice document including:
- Company header
- Invoice details
- Client information
- Itemized list of products/services
- Totals (subtotal, tax, total)

## API Performance Testing with Postman

Postman can be used to test the performance of API endpoints. Follow these steps:

### 1. Load Testing with Collection Runner
- Open Postman and create a collection with your API requests.
- Use the **Runner** feature to send multiple requests concurrently.
- Adjust the **Iterations** and **Concurrency** to simulate real-world loads.

### 2. Response Time Analysis
- Send a request and check the **Response Time** displayed in Postman.
- Aim for a response time below **200ms** for optimal performance.

### 3. Stress Testing with Postman Scripts
- Go to the **Tests** tab in Postman and add:
```javascript
pm.expect(responseTime).to.be.below(500);
```
- This ensures that responses are under **500ms**, otherwise, it fails.

### 4. Simulating Heavy Traffic with Postman CLI (Newman)
- Install Newman:
```bash
npm install -g newman
```
- Run a collection with **high iterations**:
```bash
newman run Invoices.postman_collection.json -n 100
```
- This sends **100 requests** to measure server resilience.

### 5. Benchmarking API Performance
- Use Postmanâ€™s **Monitor** feature to track API performance over time.
- Set up scheduled tests and alerts to identify slow endpoints.

By implementing these tests, you can ensure the API handles **high loads efficiently** while maintaining **fast response times**. ðŸš€
